<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>GeoDeals is a web application enabling people to share the great deals they find in their daily lives with their local community and share their opinion on deals in their area for everyone's mutual benefit.</p>
<h4>What I did</h4>
<p class="mb-0">Worked with 1 other student to build the back-end of the application:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Designed and implemented a MySQL database consisting of 13 tables with referential integrity</li>
    <li>Launched and configured an AWS EC2 instance with a LAMP stack to host the application on the internet with a custom domain</li>
    <li>Used the Slim Framework to expose a RESTful API to enable the Angular 2 front-end to interact with the back-end database</li>
</ul>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Identifies users location using the browser if they enable location services or their IP address if they don't</li>
    <li>Uses the Yelp Fusion API to retrieve information about nearby business according to the user's current location and an optional search query</li>
    <li>Event driven MySQL master-slave database replication</li>
    <li>Email verification: Email sent to user when they register and they must click embedded link before they can log in</li>
    <li>User data tracking and logging of operating system, browser, and IP address for all http requests</li>
    <li>Data cleansing with Cron and PHP scripts</li>
</ul>
