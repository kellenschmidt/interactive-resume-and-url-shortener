<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The First Year Engineering Design Robot Competition was a semester long class in which we were grouped with engineers from multiple disciplines and tasked with building a robot to autonomously navigate an obstacle course while completing objectives such as locating a soil source, testing percent water concentration, and measuring wind speed and ambient temperature.</p>
<h4>What I did</h4>
<p class="mb-0">Worked in a Scrum group of 6 engineers to construct and program the robot from scratch</p>
<ul>
    <li>Helped contruct the the robot using MicroRax (metal robotics kit) and ultrasonic, bump, light, and GPS sensors</li>
    <li>Used object-oriented Java to program the robot to autonomously navigate the course and complete the objectives</li>
    <li>Finished 2nd out of 16 teams in the final competition</li>
</ul>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Class was centered around Scrum methodology, including sprints, standups, and retrospectives</li>
    <li>I frequently acted as Scrum master to organizing the team and help alleviate blockers</li>
    <li>Robot could adapt to changing course structure and avoid other robots on the course</li>
    <li>Sensors were custom calibrated to within 5% accuracy</li>
</ul>
